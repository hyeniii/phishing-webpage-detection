## Abstract
<p>
The goal of our project is to detect and classify URL phishing attempts using a large dataset containing over 80 features related to each URL. The dataset includes both legitimate and phishing URLs and our objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify new URLs as either legitimate or phishing.

To achieve this goal, we will be deploying our machine learning model on AWS, utilizing the cloud computing resources to train and test our model. We plan to use AWS S3 to store our dataset and EC2 instances for our machine learning algorithm training and deployment.
Our team consists of four members who will be responsible for different aspects of the project, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and deployment on AWS. We will be using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow to build our model.

The outcome of our project will be a robust and accurate machine learning model that can classify new URLs as phishing or legitimate with a high degree of confidence. The deployment on AWS will allow us to scale our model to handle large volumes of data and ensure efficient processing and classification in real-time.

Overall, this project will demonstrate the power and potential of cloud computing for machine learning applications and contribute to the growing field of cybersecurity by developing an effective tool for detecting URL phishing attempts.
